## Who am I?

Hi! My name is Alo Ariza. I'm a developer (and a musician at heart!).
At the moment I live in Frankfurt and I work as a devloper in Finance using Java as my main programming language. I have also experience in the supply chain and construction industries. In which I primarly used python for data maniuplation.

Currently I'm taking the MitxPro MERN course for web development.

I love to code, and build things that can help other people be
more productive or let them have fun.
